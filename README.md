# Libreverse

Libreverse is a self-hosted alternative to the well-known large hosted collections of models for 3D printing, laser cutting, etc. (the stuff makers are interested in typically). It's a sort of static-site generator with an interactive server for development.


## Models

Originally, this repository was meant to be a collection of 3D models only. The majority was designed for 3D printing, using appropriate [design guidelines](design-guidelines.md). However, the website generator quickly turned out to be usable as a general-purpose self-hosted solution.

Therefore, the original models are now available in [libreverse-models](https://github.com/TheAssassin/libreverse-models).
